# A Simulation Study on the Effects of Evasive Animal Movement on Line Transect Abundance Estimates

(Submitted as dissertation for fulfilment of MSc Applied Statistics and Datamining degree)

A frequently used method in statistical ecology for the estimation of animal populations based
on line transect data is that of distance sampling. Since it assumes uniform
animal distribution in the area surveyed, however, such estimates are biased
when the animals respond to the observer before their detection. In this paper, we present the findings of a simulation study to assess the extent to which
the evasive responsive movement behaviour exhibited by marine turtle species
influences estimates of their abundance. Distance data showing evasive movement of varying severity were simulated on the basis of the survey design of
an ongoing project to study sea turtle-vessel interactions in the Gulf of Mexico. We examined the results from both a single boat observer, to which the
conventional distance sampling method was applied, as well as from two configurations of a boat and drone as double observers, for which mark-recapture
distance sampling was implemented. Accuracy of the estimates of the primary observer’s trackline detection probability $p_1(0)$ and of turtle abundance
$N$ in the presence of evasive movement was compared across these three methods. The single observer method showed greatest bias in abundance estimates
(−20% bias for uniform distribution and −27% for extreme movement) due to
inaccurate $p_1(0)$ estimation. The trial double observer configuration gave the
most accurate estimates of abundance (−3% bias for uniform distribution and
−14% for extreme movement), as well as of primary trackline detection probability. This study demonstrates how accurate estimates of animal abundance
can be made in the presence of evasive movement patterns.
